            Was pretty easy as all of this is a repeat of what we did in lecture. <br> 
            However, I did enjoy it qutie a bit as we get to design our own Page. <br>
            The only trouble I could think of having trouble remembering formatting etc, <br>
            but I just looked back at notes.<br><br>

            What I learned was how to use list more effectively so they don't looks mmess up.<br>
            Most importantly I learn how to use the internet to go the extra step and learned something new.<br>
            I already knew about how to write and paragraph in hmtl and how to put an image up from my ENG 102 class. <br>
            <br>
            The resources i used were the in-class code nodes to help me remember how we do something in class and <br>
            the internet to help me out on generally question or to learn new things. Like center and font size/style, etc.<br>
            The internet I use to explore my curiosity like how do you change font and size in the same line, and going off and a little <br>
            bit of tinkering around I got times new roman in better font!<br> <br>

            This Assignment was definitely tougher than the first one but it has helped me better understand how to format using CSS and how Classes <br>
            and IDs work when in the same place. However, the most important skilled I learned was how to use the inspect tool to help me debug. <br>
            When I started this assignment I was always getting lost at what class affected what area etc. The inspect tool helped me <br>
            narrow down what I needed to work/debug on. <br> <br>

            I used the inspect tool to help me figure out where I should adjust my padding/margins. Another trouble I had was figuring out how to display inline-block <br>
            and flex and understand what the difference is between them and how they behave. Also using the internet helped me search for Syntax and other little details <br>
            like for box-shadow it helped me understand what each value did which allowed me to create a faint shadow.<br> <br>

            TAs were a big help for me on this assignment as they allowed me to ask questions about why/how things work. They also taught me how to better debug my code and <br>
            key factors on what to search for when debugging.<br>
