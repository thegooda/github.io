            Was pretty easy as all of this is a repeat of what we did in lecture. <br> 
            However, I did enjoy it qutie a bit as we get to design our own Page. <br>
            The only trouble I could think of having trouble remembering formatting etc, <br>
            but I just looked back at notes.<br><br>

            What I learned was how to use list more effectively so they don't looks mmess up.<br>
            Most importantly I learn how to use the internet to go the extra step and learned something new.<br>
            I already knew about how to write and paragraph in hmtl and how to put an image up from my ENG 102 class. <br>
            <br>
            The resources i used were the in-class code nodes to help me remember how we do something in class and <br>
            the internet to help me out on generally question or to learn new things. Like center and font size/style, etc.<br>
            The internet I use to explore my curiosity like how do you change font and size in the same line, and going off and a little <br>
            bit of tinkering around I got times new roman in better font!
